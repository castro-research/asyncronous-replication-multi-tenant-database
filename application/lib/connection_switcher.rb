# Simplified connection switcher (modelled on the reference app's
# ConnectionSwitcher, without the around-hooks / multi-record machinery).
#
# A single process connects to every node: :default is the source (DB0), and
# :db1/:db2/:db3 are the regional replicas (see ApplicationRecord.connects_to).
# `switch_shard(:db1) { ... }` runs the block against the db1 connection.
#
# The active shard is the gate that tells "source originating a write"
# (:default) apart from "applying a replicated copy on a replica" (a shard) —
# which is what lets the Replicable concern decide whether to fan out, without a
# separate "applying" flag.
